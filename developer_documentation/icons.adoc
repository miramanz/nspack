== Icons

Icons are used in four ways:

* In grid action list menu items
* In grid icon columns
* By using one of the icons defined in Crossbeams::Layout
* By embedding SVG inline in HTML

=== Layout Icons

=== Embedded Icons

You should generally not need to do this.

If you do, the `svg` tag should get a class of `cbl-icon` to display at the correct size and aligned with text.
