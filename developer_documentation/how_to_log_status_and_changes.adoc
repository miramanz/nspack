== How to log status and data changes

=== 1. Log a status

Status is typically logged by using a method defined on base interactor: `log_status(table_name, id, status, comment: nil)`.

One status can be written to multiple records in a table at the same time using: `log_multiple_statuses(table_name, ids, status, comment: nil)`.

These methods should be called inside a transaction after the actual table update.

The `comment` parameter is optional, but when it is present, the status will be displayed as a concatenation of the two fields.
e.g.

* Status = 'CREATED' and comment = nil will display as `'CREATED'`.
* Status = 'APPROVED' and comment = 'by Paul' will display as `'APPROVED by Paul'`.

e.g.
[source, ruby]
----
  repo.transaction do
    repo.update_security_group(id, attrs)
    repo.log_transaction
    repo.log_status('security_groups', id, 'SOMETHING_CHANGED')
  end
----

NOTE: statuses are logged to two tables in the database within the `audit` schema. -- `audit.current_statuses` (just the current status of a record) and `audit.status_logs` (history of all statuses for a record).

=== 2. Display the current status

The current status can be returned from the database like this:
[source, ruby]
----
DB[Sequel.function(:fn_current_status, 'security_groups', 68)].single_value
----

Or it can be returned using `find_with_association`.
[source, ruby]
----
find_with_association(:security_groups, 123, lookup_functions: [{ function: :fn_current_status, args: ['security_groups', :id], col_name: :status }])
----

The current status can also be returned in a query -- usually used in a grid query definition:
[source, sql]
----
SELECT id, security_group, fn_current_status('security_groups', id) AS status
FROM security_groups;
----

=== 3. Show the status of a record from an action in a grid

There is a standard URL to call that displays the current status of a record as well as historical statuses. When possible, the display links to the data that changed during the transaction.

Add the URL `/development/statuses/show/security_groups/$:id$` to the yml file:
[source, yml]
----
- :url: /development/statuses/list/security_groups/$:id$
  :text: status
  :icon: information-solid
  :title: Status
  :popup: true
----

=== 4. Customise the header display for a status object

The form that shows status history can optionally display header information for a resource at the top of the form.

To get something displayed there, modify `config/status_header_definitions.rb` to specify a query to be run.

e.g.
[source, ruby]
----
HEADER_DEF = {
  mr_deliveries: {                                                       #<1>
    query: 'SELECT delivery_number, FROM mr_deliveries WHERE id = ?',    #<2>
    headers: { delivery_number: 'Delivery' },                            #<3>
    caption: 'Delivery'                                                  #<4>
  },
  security_groups: {
    query: 'SELECT security_group_name FROM security_groups WHERE id = ?'
  }
}.freeze
----
<1> The key is the table name as a Symbol
<2> The query must be present and the WHERE clause **must** be `WHERE id = ?`.
<3> `:headers` is optional. Use this for any table columns that aren't suitable for a header.
<4> `:caption` is optional.

=== 5. Log data changes

Data changes are stored in two tables in the `audit` schema -- `audit.logged_actions` and `audit.logged_action_details`.

Changes are logged to `logged_actions` automatically if a migration was run that created triggers to log changes to the table -- e.g.:
[source, ruby]
----
run "SELECT audit.audit_table('security_groups', true, true,'{updated_at}'::text[]);"
----

Logging to the `logged_action_details` table is done manually. This table stores the user name and the webapp route and optionally other context. This data can be joined to the actual changes in the `logged_actions` table via the `transaction_id` value.

To log details, do the following in a route and an interactor:
[source, ruby]
----
  # In a route - set the route_url (context can be left out):
  interactor = SecurityApp::SecurityGroupInteractor.new(current_user, {},
                { route_url: request.path,
                  context: 'Something that might be useful' }, {})

  # In an interactor:
  repo.transaction do
    repo.update_security_group(id, attrs)
    repo.log_transaction
  end
----

NOTE: If a table has been set up (via the triggers) to log data changes, your code _should_ also call `log_transaction` so that the audit trail of which user and URL were involved in a particular change can be retrieved.
