== Response objects

Response objects are defined in the module `Crossbeams::Responses`.

They are used to return a structured response from a method that has the following payload:

success :: A boolean which is true if the method succeeded.
instance :: Optional. Relevant data.
errors :: Optional. Specific error messages - typically for validation of fields.
message :: A message to describe the result.

=== Setup

A class should `include Crossbeams::Responses`. Note that classes inheriting from `BaseRepo`, `BaseInteractor` and `BaseService` already include the module.

Methods in the class can generate crossbeams responses using the methods:

* `success_response`
* `ok_response`
* `failed_response`
* `validation_failed_message_response`
* `validation_failed_response`
* `mixed_validation_failed_response`


See link:/yarddocthis/lib=cecrossbeams_responses.rb[Crossbeams::Responses methods] for a list of the method definitions described below.

=== Success responses

These are `success_response` and `ok_response`. They always return `success == true` and a `message`.
Use `ok_response` when you just need to denote success and the `message` is unimportant.

success_response :: Requires a message.
ok_response :: Returns message 'ok'.

=== Failure response

This method is called `failed_response` and always returns `success == false` and a `message`.
Can optionally return `instance`.

failed_response :: Requires a failure message.

=== Validation responses

There are three validation responses. They always returns `success == false` and `message == 'Validation error'`.
The `errors` should always return validation error message(s) per field in error.

validation_failed_message_response :: Use this to just pass the validation errors.
validation_failed_response :: Use this to pass the validation errors with an instance.
mixed_validation_failed_response :: Use this to combine two or more validation results.

Validation responses are usually called with a `Dry::Validation::Result` instance, but can also be called with a `Hash` or `OpenStruct`.
