== How to use repositories

* Repositories are the layer between application code and the database.
* Repositories handle all the database reads and writes.
* Application code should not perform any database calls directly - only through a repository method - and all SQL should be defined in repository methods.
* The only exception to this is in the SQL in dataminer yml query definition files.
* A repository method should return only `Hash`es, `Dry::Struct`s, `OpenStruct`s -- or `Array`s of one of the three.
