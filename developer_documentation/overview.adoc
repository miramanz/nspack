== Overview

The system is designed as an application that is loaded inside a web application which uses the `Roda` routing tree gem to handle request endpoints which call into the application.

The application can also be loaded without the routing tree which allows it to be called from the commandline (e.g. a Rake task), the {abbr-repl} `bin/console`, or have other servers (like a TCP server) load it.

.How the code is organised and loaded

In the typical case, a Rack-enabled webserver (Passenger, Thin, Puma, Webrick etc.) loads `config.ru` which loads `webapp.rb`.
`webapp.rb` loads `app_loader.rb` which loads the application and then loads the `Roda` routing tree.

The application is made up of shared code (typically in gems or base classes to be inherited) and of applets. Applets are logical groupings of code.

== Applets

Applets are responsible for loading all the code related to a particular domain.

.Applet code organisation

Applets do not have to define all units -- just what is required.

== Grids

Lists of data are displayed in pages using data grids. These can be any of:

list:: Runs a query and returns all rows.
lookup:: Runs a query which might be filtered and returns rows -- one of which can be selected.
search:: Presents a page where the user can fill in parameters before the query is run, returning the filtered rows.

The YAML files allow for defining actions to be taken per row as well as other configurations to be used e.g. in defining a grid as a multiselect grid.
