== JSON rendering

This doc shows which helpers are available in route files to return JSON responses to update the page without reloading.

=== Updating a dialog

==== Replace the contents of a dialog

Renders the text in `:content` in the current dialog's body.

    update_dialog_content(content:, notice: nil, error: nil)

==== Change the contents of a dialog by loading another URL

Replaces the current dialog's content with the response from `url`.

    load_via_json(url, notice: nil)

==== Change the contents of a window by loading another URL

Replaces the current window's content with the response from `url`.
This should be used in the response to a link loaded in a "loading_window" (see Link: `loading_window` option).

    change_window_location_via_json(new_location, log_url = nil)

==== Redirect to the last grid

This uses a redirect to load the page that rendered the last grid.

    redirect_to_last_grid(route)

==== Redirect to a URL

Pass the URL and the app will redirect to it.

  redirect_via_json(url)

==== Redirect to either a grid or page (using stored referer)

Sometimes a page can be launched from a grid or from one or more other pages and after some action has been taken, you want to redirect to the appropriate page.

To do this, from the _launched_ page route, call:

  store_last_referer_url(key)

This will store the referer URL (the page that launched this page/dialog) in local storage.

Then when you want to redirect back, call:

  redirect_via_json_to_stored_referer(key)

NOTE: `key` in both cases is a `Symbol`.

==== Reload the dialog that opened the current dialog

When a dialog opens another dialog, you might want to close the second dialog and then reload (refresh) the first dialog with the response from the original or another URL.

    reload_previous_dialog_via_json(url, notice: nil)

==== Close the dialog and update the grid

After a grid action opens a dialog and changes are saved from the dialog, you might want to update certain values on the currect row without reloading the page.

    update_grid_row(ids, changes:, notice: nil)

`id` is the id of the row to change, but can also be an array of ids if you want to update several rows with the same changes.
`changes` is a Hash of symbol key/values where the symbol key matches the field name in the grid and the value is what you want to place in the grid cell.

==== Close the dialog and add a row to the grid

Like with updating a grid row, this will close the dialog and append a row to the underlying grid.

    add_grid_row(attrs:, notice: nil)

`attrs` is a Hash of symbol key/values where the symbol key matches the field name in the grid and the value is what you want to place in the grid cell.

`add_grid_row` will automatically set the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields in the new row if the grid has them (so they do not need to be included int the `attrs` Hash).

=== Changing DOM elements

The main helper for this is `json_actions` which receives an array of actions to be carried out in the page and an optional flash message to be displayed and optional flag to indicate that a dialog should not be closed after processing the response in the page.
Each action is of a specific type which tells the calling javascript what to do.

e.g.
[source,ruby]
----
json_actions(actions, message = nil, keep_dialog_open: false)

json_actions([OpenStruct.new(type: :replace_multi_options,
                             dom_id: 'product_code_columns_product_code_column_ids',
                             options_array: res.instance[:code]),
              OpenStruct.new(type: :replace_input_value,
                             dom_id: 'product_code_columns_chosen_column_ids',
                             value: ids.join(','))],
             'Re-assigned product columns')

==== Actions

===== Replace the value of an input element

Works on `input` elements (including hidden or disabled ones).

type: `:replace_input_value`.

dom_id: the value of the `id` attribute of the input element in the page. This is usually a combination of the `form_name` and `field_name`.
e.g. if a form named `users` has a field named `surname`, then the dom_id will be `users_surname`.

value: the value you want to change it to.

===== Change the value of a select element

Works on `select` elements.

type: `:change_select_value`.

dom_id: the value of the `id` attribute of the select element in the page. This is usually a combination of the `form_name` and `field_name`.
e.g. if a form named `users` has a field named `surname`, then the dom_id will be `users_surname`.

value: the value of the option you want to be selected.

===== Replace the inner HTML of a DOM element

Works on DOM elements (usually for label text).

type: `:replace_inner_html`.

dom_id: the value of the `id` attribute of the element in the page.

value: the value you want to change it to.

===== Replace the options in a multi element

Works on `Multi.js` elements only.

type: `:replace_multi_options`.

dom_id: as for `:replace_input_value`.

options_array: A one- or two-dimensional array.

===== Replace the options in a select element

Works on `Selectr.js` elements only.

type: `replace_select_options`

dom_id: as for `:replace_input_value`.

options_array: A one- or two-dimensional array.

===== Replace the items in a list element

Works on `ol` or `ul` elements only.

type: `:replace_list_items`.

dom_id: as for `:replace_input_value`.

items: An array of `Strings`.

===== Hide a DOM element

Works on any DOM element with an id.

type: `:hide_element`.

dom_id: the value of the `id` attribute of the element in the page. This will typically be the id of the field_wrapper of an input. (See note below).

reclaim_space: (optional, defaults to true) - if true, the page will repaint to use the hidden area. If not, the hidden element will become a blank area in the page. This is generally better in order to stop inputs from moving around on the page too much.

===== Show a DOM element

Works on any DOM element with an id.

type: `:show_element`.

dom_id: the value of the `id` attribute of the element in the page. This will typically be the id of the field_wrapper of an input. (See note below).

reclaim_space: (optional, defaults to true) - if true, the page will rearange to accomodate the shown area. If not, the element will become visible in the already-blank area in the page. This is generally better in order to stop inputs from moving around on the page too much.

NOTE: _wrapper_id_ : If a field is named `name` in a form named `users`, the input field's id will be `users_name` and the div surrounding the input and label will have the id `users_name_field_wrapper`.

===== Clear validation error messages from a form

Clears all UI text and styling from validation errors of a particular form.

type: `:clear_form_validation`.

dom_id: the `id` of the `<form>`. (Use `form.form_id 'abc'` in the view to set this value)

===== Add a row to a grid

As part of a set of actions, adds a row to a grid.

type: `:add_grid_row`.
attrs: a Hash of symbol key/values where the symbol key matches the field name in the grid and the value is what you want to place in the grid cell.

===== Update a grid row

As part of a set of actions, updates the columns of a row or rows in a grid.

type: `:update_grid_row`.

ids: the id (or Array of ids) of the row(s) to change.
changes: a Hash of symbol key/values where the symbol key matches the field name in the grid and the value is what you want to place in the grid cell.

===== Delete a grid row

type: `:delete_grid_row`.

id: the id of the row to delete.

==== Single actions

There are also helper methods available that are easier to use when only returning a singe action.
These work exactly the same as for their counterparts above.

[source,ruby]
----
json_replace_select_options(dom_id, options_array, message: nil, keep_dialog_open: false)

json_replace_multi_options(dom_id, options_array, message: nil, keep_dialog_open: false)

json_replace_input_value(dom_id, value, message: nil, keep_dialog_open: false)

json_replace_list_items(dom_id, items, message: nil, keep_dialog_open: false)

json_clear_form_validation(dom_id, message: nil, keep_dialog_open: false)
----

== Other responses

=== Empty (blank) response

When there is no need to do anything at all, you can return a plain JSON success response.

  blank_json_response

This merely responds with status `200`.

=== Undo an inline edit of a grid column

Undo an inline-edit from a grid (e.g. when a validation fails). Optionally display a message.

  undo_grid_inline_edit(message: nil, message_type: :warn)

* `message` is an optional message to display.
* `message_type` is the message style which can be `:info`, `:error`, `:warning` or `:notice`. Defaults to `:warn`.

[source,ruby]
----
res = interactor.method_that_could_fail(params)
if res.success
  # ..
else
  undo_grid_inline_edit(message: res.message, message_type: :warn)
end
