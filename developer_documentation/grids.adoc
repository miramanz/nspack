== Grids

=== List filtered by url parameter

To achieve this you add a `:conditions` section to your list yaml file. NB all `col` values must have a query parameter definition in the dataminer report as defined in `dataminer_queries`.

This section can have more than one set of conditions as they can have separate keys. This allows you to use the same list file in different ways - see (3) below.

==== 1. As a page

Given a URL like this: `/list/order_items/with_params?key=standard&id=1` we will display a list of order items where the order id is `1`.

To achieve this, the `order_items.yml` file would include the following:
[source,yaml]
----
:conditions:
  :standard:          # <1>
    - :col: order_id  # <2>
      :op: =          # <3>
      :val: $:id$     # <4>
----
<1> This matches the value of the `key` parameter from the page url.
<2> The column to be filtered. There can be more than one set of columns (repeated with a `-` as YAML array items).
<3> The operator. This will usually be `=`, but can be another operator.
<4> The parameter from the page url (in this case `id`) is wrapped in `$:` and `$`.

This will become a WHERE clause like this: `WHERE order_id = 1`.

==== 2. As a section of a page

In this case you have a page with a form for header data and a grid for item data. As an example, we use order and order items - where `order_items` has an `order_id` column (belongs_to `id` on `orders`). And we use the same `order_items.yml` fila as above.

[source,ruby]
----
layout = Crossbeams::Layout::Page.new form_object: obj
layout.build do |page, page_config|
  page.section do |section|
    section.form do
      # ...
    end
  end
  page.section do |section|
    section.add_grid('order_grid',
                     '/list/order_items',     # <1>
                     caption: 'Order Items',
                     grid_params: params)     # <2>
  end
end
----
<1> The url contains the yaml file name (`order_items`).
<2> Pass in the parameters which in this case should be `{ key: 'standard', id: 1 }`. These will match in the same way as set out above.

==== 3. Several conditions in one list YAML file

This example of `order_items.yml` list file will return different rows for the following two urls:

* `/list/order_items/with_params?key=standard&id=1`
* `/list/order_items/with_params?key=customer&id=5&active=false`

[source,yaml]
----
:conditions:
  :standard:          # <1>
    - :col: order_id
      :op: =
      :val: $:id$
  :customer:          # <2>
    - :col: customer_id
      :op: =
      :val: $:id$
    - :col: active
      :op: =
      :val: $:active$
----
<1> Key is `standard`, uses `WHERE order_id = 1`
<2> Key is `customer`, uses `WHERE customer_id = 5 AND NOT active`

=== Controls at the top of the page

Links can be specified to appear at the top of the page. Typically they will be styled as buttons.

This uses the same options as for link:/developer_documentation/non_field_renderers.adoc#_link[Link], but has the extra option `:hide_if_sql_returns_true` and `:hide_for_key`.

The value of `:hide_if_sql_returns_true` **must** be a valid snippet of SQL that returns `true` or `false`. Typical is to return the result of an `EXISTS` query.

The value of `:hide_for_key` **must** be an array of one or more strings. If any string matches the value of the `key=` parameter of the URL that loaded the page, the control will be hidden.

This example will display an anchor (`<a>`) styled as a button that will render in a popup dialog when clicked.

NOTE: The `grid_id` option will need to match the id of your grid if your action is going to call one of the helpers that add or update a grid's rows.

[source,yaml]
----
- :control_type: :link
  :url: "/masterfiles/locations/locations/new"
  :text: New Location
  :style: :button
  :behaviour: :popup
  :grid_id: something
  :hide_if_sql_returns_true: SELECT EXISTS(SELECT id FROM locations)
  :hide_for_key:
    - inactive
    - someotherkey
----

=== Calculated columns

Columns can be specified to be calculated by the grid. This is especailly useful a column value is changed and any calculations that uses its value can adjust automatically.

[source,yaml]
----
:calculated_columns:                            # <1>
  - :name: total_price                          # <2>
    :caption: Total price                       # <3>
    :data_type: :number                         # <4>
    :format: :delimited_1000                    # <5>
    :expression: quantity_required * unit_price # <6>
    :position: 9                                # <7>
----
<1> There can be any number of calculated columns in the array.
<2> `name` must be unique amongst all columns of the grid.
<3> `caption` - the column header.
<4> `data_type` - usually `:numeric`. Can be `:integer`.
<5> `format` is optional.
<6> `expression` - this is the calculation - use a combination of column names and `*, /, + or -`.
<7> `position` - the position to place the calculated column in the list of columns. Note that hidden columns also have position.

=== Inline editing rules

You can specify columns that can be edited inline in a list yaml file.

Every time an editable cell is changed, a URL will be called with the row id, the name of the changed field and the cell's old and new values.

[source,yaml]
----
:edit_rules:
  :url: /path/to/$:id$/inline_save       # <1>
  :editable_fields:                      # <2>
    code:                                # <3>
    description:
      :editor: :textarea                 # <4>
    amount:
      :editor: :numeric                  # <5>
    condition:
      :editor: :select                   # <6>
      :values:                           # <7>
        - Ok
        - Fair
        - Poor
    role:
      :editor: :select
      :value_sql: SELECT code FROM roles # <8>
----
<1> This is required. The url should include `$:id$` which will be replaced with the row's id value.
<2> This is required. `editable_fields` is a Hash of column names with options for editing.
<3> A column name key with no value will use the default text cell editor.
<4> A textarea editor.
<5> The numeric editor does not allow alphabetic characters.
<6> A select editor **must** have a `values` or `value_sql` setting.
<7> `values` is an array of values.
<8> `value_sql` must be a SELECT query. The first column of every row forms the select's options.

NOTE: The field name keys for `editable_fields` are Strings, not Symbols, so they do not get a `:` in front.

The route action can use any JSON actions to update the page (maybe update other columns in the grid row), or just display a JSON notice. This will be a POST request with the following parameters:
[source,ruby]
----
params[:column_name]  # => The name of the updated field.
params[:column_value] # => The new value of the updated field.
params[:old_value]    # => The value before it was updated in the grid.
----

Here's a contrived example:
[source,ruby]
----
r.on 'inline_save' do # COLUMN EDITED IN GRID
  check_auth!('a_program', 'edit')
  res = do_some_interactor_stuff
  if res.success
    json_actions([OpenStruct.new(type: :update_grid_row,
                                 ids: id,
                                 changes: { log: "Changed at #{Time.now}" })],
                 "Changed #{params[:column_name]},
                  from \"#{params[:old_value]}\"
                  to \"#{params[:column_value]}\".")
    # OR - if there is no need to provide feedback:
    blank_json_response
  else
    show_json_error(res.message, status: 200)
  end
end
----

=== Display a tree

A query can be displayed as a tree grid if each row returns an array column that contains the row's ancestors.
Also the list or search yml must provide some config values like the following:

[source,yaml]
----
:tree:
  :tree_column: path_array           # <1>
  :tree_caption: Location Hierarchy  # <2>
  :suppress_node_counts: false       # <3>
  :groupDefaultExpanded: 1           # <4>
----
<1> `path_array` in this instance is the resultset column that contains the ancestors of the current row in an ordered array. See SQL example below.
<2> The caption of the grid column that shows the expandable tree hierarchy.
<3> If `false`, each node in the grid will show the number of child nodes. Set to true to hide the counts.
<4> How many levels in the hierarchy to expand on display. Default is `0`. Set to `-1` to expand all.

==== Example SQL for a tree using the closure table method

[source,sql]
----
SELECT "locations"."id", "locations"."location_long_code", "locations"."location_description",
(SELECT array_agg("sub"."location_long_code") AS path
  FROM (SELECT "loc"."location_long_code"
          FROM "locations" loc
          JOIN "tree_locations" tree ON "tree"."ancestor_location_id" = "loc"."id"
          WHERE "tree"."descendant_location_id" = "locations"."id"
          ORDER BY "tree"."path_length" DESC) sub) AS path_array,
(SELECT max("path_length")
  FROM "tree_locations"
  WHERE "descendant_location_id" = "locations"."id") + 1 AS level
FROM "locations"
JOIN "location_types" ON "location_types"."id" = "locations"."location_type_id"
JOIN "location_assignments" ON "location_assignments"."id" = "locations"."primary_assignment_id"
JOIN "location_storage_types" ON "location_storage_types"."id" = "locations"."primary_storage_type_id"
ORDER BY (SELECT string_agg("sub"."location_long_code", ';') AS path
            FROM (SELECT "loc"."location_long_code"
            FROM "locations" loc
            JOIN "tree_locations" tree ON "tree"."ancestor_location_id" = "loc"."id"
            WHERE "tree"."descendant_location_id" = "locations"."id"
            ORDER BY "tree"."path_length" DESC) sub)

=== Simple row colouring

The grid will automatically set the font colour of a row to grey and make it italic if the row has a column named `active` which has a value of `false`.

The grid query can return a rule for colouring a row in a column named `colour_rule`. If there is a value in the column,
the grid will apply it as a class (or classes) for the row. If it is nil, the row colour will remain at the default (black).
This column should always be hidden.

NOTE: There are five standard classes that should be used in most cases. They are `ok`, `warning`, `error`, `inactive` and `inprogress`. Only use other classes if these five do not cover your requirement.

Because this column's value is applied as a class, it can be anything, not just colour - e.g. bold (`b`), italic (`em`).

Your queries should preferably return Tachyons classes rather than custom classes (except for the background classes - Tachyons cannot be used here because the grid design means we have to apply `!important` to the class style).

Try to exercise restraint - only colour rows if it will be useful to the user. Not every grid needs to be lit up like a christmas tree!

Example:
[source,sql]
----
SELECT
CASE WHEN cancelled THEN 'b gray'  -- gray and bold Tachyon classes for cancelled
     WHEN approved THEN 'ok'       -- green for approved
     WHEN completed THEN 'warning' -- orange for complete but not yet approved
     ELSE NULL                     -- default to no class
     END AS colour_rule,           -- column must be named "colour_rule"
*
FROM invoices

Some useful Tachyons (and built-in) classes:

|===
|class |description

|b
|*Bold text*

|i
|_Italic text_

|ttl
|lowercase text

|ttu
|UPPERCASE text

|error
|pass:[<span class="red">Example text colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|warning
|pass:[<span class="orange">Example text colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|ready
|pass:[<span class="blue">Example text colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|ok
|pass:[<span class="green">Example text colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|inactive
|pass:[<span class="gray i">Example text colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|inprogress
|pass:[<span class="purple">Example text colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|**NOTE** The following should be _rarely_ used:
|**These classes are defined but should ideally not be used.**
The background colours will override the grid's `hover` and `selected` row colouring -- makes UX confusing.

|grid-row-bg-light-red
|pass:[<span class="grid-row-bg-light-red">Example background colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|grid-row-bg-gold
|pass:[<span class="grid-row-bg-gold">Example background colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|grid-row-bg-yellow
|pass:[<span class="grid-row-bg-yellow">Example background colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|grid-row-bg-light-yellow
|pass:[<span class="grid-row-bg-light-yellow">Example background colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|grid-row-bg-washed-yellow
|pass:[<span class="grid-row-bg-washed-yellow">Example background colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|grid-row-bg-light-purple
|pass:[<span class="grid-row-bg-light-purple">Example background colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|grid-row-bg-pink
|pass:[<span class="grid-row-bg-pink">Example background colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|grid-row-bg-light-pink
|pass:[<span class="grid-row-bg-light-pink">Example background colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|grid-row-bg-green
|pass:[<span class="grid-row-bg-green">Example background colour as if in a grid row</span>]

|grid-row-bg-light-green
|pass:[<span class="grid-row-bg-light-green">Example background colour as if in a grid row</span>]
