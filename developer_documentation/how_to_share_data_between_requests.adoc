== How to share data between requests

Sometimes you need an action to pick up some data from an earlier action without having to pass it via a url's queryparams or hidden fields.
Rack::Session can be used to store the data, but this is discouraged so that the session can be kept as lean as possible.

=== Basic - store a value and use it later

Use the helpers `store_locally` and `retrieve_from _local_store`. On retrieval, the value is removed from the store and is no longer accessible.

An example:
[source,ruby]
----
r.on 'group_edit' do # NEW
  store_locally(:sec_from, 'group')
  # Display a form
end
r.on 'edit' do       # EDIT
  store_locally(:sec_from, 'permission')
  # Display a form
end

r.patch do         # UPDATE
  # Update some data
  key = retrieve_from_local_store(:sec_from)
  r.redirect "/apath/#{key}"
end
----

=== Return to an unknown URL

Sometimes you need to redirect to one of two or more url options, but don't know what path was taken to get to your action.
Use `store_last_referer` to store the URL that called the action and `redirect_to_stored_referer` to later redirect to that URL.

Example: a `new` action can be called from grid_a or from grid_b:
[source,ruby]
----
r.on 'new' do    # NEW - might be from a link on /examples or on /samples
  store_last_referer_url(:an_example)
  # Display a form
end

r.post do         # CREATE
  # Update some data
  redirect_to_stored_referer(r, :an_example) # will go to /examples or /samples
end
----

=== Return to a grid

Often the same action can be called from more than one grid (e.g. `/list/something` or `/search/something`).
When the form from that action is submitted you want to reload the correct grid without knowing which one it was.

Both `/list` and `/search` paths will set the last grid for you (but **only** if the grid is rendered in a page, not a dialog).
You would need to set the grid yourself if you are rendering it yourself from code.

In that case you will use `set_last_grid_url`.
To return to the (unknown) grid, use `redirect_to_last_grid`.

Example: a new form can be displayed from a '/list' page (in which case the last grid is automatically stored) -- or the new form can be displayed from a menu option -- in which case the last grid needs to be stored so that we can redirect to it after create.
[source,ruby]
----
r.on 'new' do    # NEW
  set_last_grid('/list/agrid', r)
  # Display a form
end

r.post do         # CREATE
  # Update some data
  redirect_to_last_grid
end
----

=== Stash a page

This is used typically when a form is in error and you need to re-show it after a redirect. The `stash_page` command will store a rendered form and the `show_partial_or_page` helper will re-render it. 

Example:
[source, ruby]
----
r.on 'edit' do
  # This will display the stashed page if present, else render the view.
  show_partial_or_page(r) { SomeModule::Edit.call(id) }
end

r.on 'update' do
  res = interactor.do_something
  if res.success
    # Do the usual happy path stuff...
  else
    flash[:error] = res.message
    # This will render and save the view with error conditions.
    stash_page(SomeModule::Edit.call(id, form_values: params[:whatever],
                                         form_errors: res.errors))
    r.redirect "/apath/#{id}/edit"
  end
end
----

=== Keeping track of steps (wizard)

Sometimes a process can go over several requests - gathering data and user decisions before commiting a change or carrying out an action at the end. In this case you want to store a rich set of data in the backend as you go along and apply at the final stage.

In the front end you might use a link:/developer_documentation/non_field_renderers.adoc#_progressstep[ProgressStep control], and at the backend you'd create a step class that inherits from BaseStep. The step class will typically be used in interactors and should be created in the appropriate interactors directory. It is basically a wrapper around a Hash stored uniquely for the current user and step identifier.

An example step class:
[source, ruby]
----
module SomeApp
  class SomeStep < BaseStep
    def initialize(user)
      super(user, :some_steps) # The identifier of this step. Ket to user's local store.
    end

    def a_description
      current_step = read      # Reads the stored data (a Hash)
      "On step #{current_step[:step_no]} of #{current_step[:total_steps]}."
    end
  end
end
----

And sample usage:
[source, ruby]
----
# lib/some/interactors/some_interactor.rb
def stepper
  @stepper ||= SomeStep.new(@user)
end

# …
stepper.write(step_no: 1, total_steps: 4)

# …
stepper.merge(some_data: 'what it is')

# …
vars = stepper.read
vars[:step_no] = 2
stepper.write(vars)

# …
vars = stepper.read
p vars[:step_no]        # => 2
p vars[:some_data]      # => "what it is"
p stepper.a_description # => "On step 2 of 4."
